    A Machine learning based classification and prediction Technique for DDoS Attacks
    The appearance of malicious apps is a serious threat to the Android platform. Most types of network interfaces based on the integrated functions, steal users' personal information and start the attack operations. In this paper, we propose an effective and automatic malware detection method using the text semantics of network traffic. In particular, we consider each HTTP flow generated by mobile apps as a text document, which can be processed by natural language processing to extract text-level features. Later, the use of network traffic is used to create a useful malware detection model. We examine the traffic flow header using N-gram method from the natural language processing (NLP). Then, we propose an automatic feature selection algorithm based on chi-square test to identify meaningful features. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables. We propose a novel solution to perform malware detection using NLP methods by treating mobile traffic as documents. We apply an automatic feature selection algorithm based on N-gram sequence to obtain meaningful features from the semantics of traffic flows. Our methods reveal some malware that can prevent detection of antiviral scanners. In addition, we design a detection system to drive traffic to your own-institutional enterprise network, home network, and 3G / 4G mobile network. Integrating the system connected to the computer to find suspicious network behaviors.
